# ChatGPT on Telegram
ChatGPT is a chatbot that uses the OpenAI GPT-3 language model to generate human-like responses to user messages. It has been integrated with the Telegram messaging platform, allowing users to chat with ChatGPT through their Telegram app or on the web.

## How to use ChatGPT
To use ChatGPT, you will need a Telegram account and the Telegram app (available for both mobile and desktop). Once you have an account, you can find ChatGPT by searching for its username on Telegram, which is @chatgpt_bot.

To start chatting with ChatGPT, simply send it a message and it will respond with a generated response. You can ask ChatGPT questions, have a conversation with it, or just have fun chatting. ChatGPT is capable of understanding and responding to a wide variety of topics, so feel free to engage with it on any subject that interests you.

### Disclaimer
Please note that ChatGPT is a chatbot and is not a human. Its responses are generated using advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, but it may not always produce responses that are accurate, appropriate, or sensitive to your individual circumstances. Use ChatGPT at your own risk, and always use common sense and good judgment when interacting with it or any other chatbot.
