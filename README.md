# ChatGPT on Telegram
ChatGPT is a chatbot that uses the OpenAI GPT-3 language model to generate human-like responses to user messages. It has been integrated with the Telegram messaging platform, allowing users to chat with ChatGPT through their Telegram app or on the web.

## How to use ChatGPT
To use ChatGPT, you will need a Telegram account and the Telegram app (available for both mobile and desktop). Once you have an account, you can find ChatGPT by searching for its username on Telegram, which is @chatgpt_bot.

To start chatting with ChatGPT, simply send it a message and it will respond with a generated response. You can ask ChatGPT questions, have a conversation with it, or just have fun chatting. ChatGPT is capable of understanding and responding to a wide variety of topics, so feel free to engage with it on any subject that interests you.
